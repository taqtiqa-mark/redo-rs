rc_include all.rc

# We include $LIBM here just as example of how to
# specify an auto-detected library as part of the
# linker settings for a binary.  We don't actually
# use it for anything.  Note that $LIBM was detected
# up above in the rc_include, because all.rc depends
# on rc/libm.rc. If the library is not available,
# $LIBM will be blank.
